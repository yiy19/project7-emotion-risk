#### Load data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(labelled)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
library(psych)
library(haven)

```

```{r load-data}
risk <- read_sav("data/risk_nonlabelled.sav")
```


#### Exclusion
```{r exclusion}
# convert types
risk <- risk %>% 
  mutate_if(is.labelled, labelled::to_factor)

# exclude those who failed at attention checks and who didn't consent to participate
risk_excluded <- risk %>% 
  filter(attention1 == 7 & attention2 == 3 & consent == 1)


```


There is one non-consent. This observation needs to be excluded. 

After excluding those who didn't consent to participate and those who failed at either of the two attention check questions, there were 579 participants remaining to be part of analysis.
